# First_BigData_project
In this repository is stored the source code that solves the problems presented in the first Big Data project for master degree course in Computer Science Engineering at Politecnico di Bari.
The project is composed by three different jobs, performed in MapReduce, each one requires to retrive and compute some information from Erasmus Mobility Dataset (https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/erasmus-mobility-statistics-2014-2019-v2?locale=en). In particular, the jobs require the follow:
1. for each senfing organization, return the receiving organization with the biggest number of participants;
2. for each nationality, return the average age of participants;
3. return the 5 fields of education with the biggest number of participants.

Here it is shown a possible implementation of the three MapReduce jobs written in Java.
